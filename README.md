Group3_Code.ddl is just the database generation code that gets fed back into the modeler software to generate up to date ERDs.

GROUP3.sql is where I have been working on code and perfecting before moving it into the G3_darksprings.sql file that will be turned in.

G3_Darksprings.sql contains absolutely everything that will be turned in for the project. It also includes functions to blow up every single object in our user context and start over. Be careful running the whole doc if you care about something in the database and aren't ready to lose it.
